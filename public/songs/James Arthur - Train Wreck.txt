James Arthur - Train Wreck

[Intro]
Em x4
 
 
[Verse 1]
Em
Laying in the silence
Am
Waiting for the sirens
C                     Em
Signs, any signs I'm alive still
Em
I don't wanna lose it
    D
But I'm not getting through this
Am            C
Hey, should I pray
         Em             D
Should I pray, yeah, to myself
                     N.C.
To a God? To a saviour who can
 
 
[Chorus]
Em          D
Unbreak the broken
Em          D      C
Unsay these spoken words
 
Find hope in the hopeless
G                          C
Pull me out the train wreck
           D    Em
Unburn the ashes
        D             C
Unchain the reactions now
 
I'm not ready to die not yet
G               Em         C
Pull me out the train wreck
C                    Em
Pull me out, pull me out
        D    C
Pull me out, pull me out
Em           D
Pull me out
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em
Underneath our bad blood
Em
We've still got a sanctum
Am            C             Em
Home, still a home, still a home here
             C
It's not too late to build it back
         Em
'Cause a one in a million chance
           D
Is still a chance, still a chance
            N.C.
And I would take those odds
 
 
[Chorus]
C           D
Unbreak the broken
Em          D      C
Unsay these spoken words
 
Find hope in the hopeless
G
Pull me out the train wreck
C          D
Unburn the ashes
Em          D
Unchain the reactions now
C
I'm not ready to die, not yet
G               Em         C
Pull me out the train wreck
C                     Em
Pull me out, pull me out
        D    C
Pull me out, pull me out
        Em           D
Pull me out, pull me out
 
 
[Bridge]
        C
You can say what you like
                          Em          D
 'cause see, I would die for you (ohohohoh)
C
I'm down on my knees
                        D
And I need you to be my God
 
Be my help, be a saviour
     N.C.
Who can
 
 
[Chorus]
C           D
Unbreak the broken
Em          D        C
Unsay these reckless words
          N.C.
Find hope in the hopeless
G                    C
Pull me out the train wreck
           D
Unburn the ashes
Em          D
Unchain the reactions now
C                     N.C.
I'm not ready to die, not yet
G                     C
Pull me out the train wreck
                     Em
Pull me out, pull me out
        D    C
Pull me out, pull me out
        Em           D
Pull me out, pull me out
