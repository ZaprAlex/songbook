[Verse 1]
Am                        G                        D/F#
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
Am                       G                   D/F#
Strange what desire will make foolish people do.
Am                   G                      D/F#
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
Am                   G                      D/F#
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.

No, I... don't want to fall in love.(This world is only gonna break your heart)
    Am   G                     D/F#
No, I... don't want to fall in love.(This world is only gonna break your heart)

With you.    (This world is only gonna break your heart)

 What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.
Am             G           D/F#
 What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.
Am             G            D/F#
 What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.
Am             G           D/F#
 What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you.
 
[Chorus]
    Am  G                D/F#
And I... want to fall in love.(This world is only gonna break your heart)
    Am  G                D/F#
No, I... want to fall in love.(This world is only gonna break your heart)
     Am  G  D/F#
With you.
