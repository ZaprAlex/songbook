[Intro]
Am   F   C   G
 
[Chorus]
Am             F           C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am   F
Separate my siiii-iiide
  C      G                  Am   F
I don't, don't believe it's baaa-aaad
C                       G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever
 
[Verse 1]
Am                              Em
   I heard your voice through a photograph
Am                             Em
   I thought it up and brought up the past
Am                       Em
   Once you know you can never go back
            G              A*
I've got to take it on the otherside
 
[Verse 2]
Am                      Em
  Centuries are what it meant to me
Am                   Em
  A cemetery where I marry the sea
Am                      Em
  Stranger things never change my mind
            G              A
I've got to take it on the otherside
G              A
Take it on the otherside
G*
Take it on
A*
Take it on
 
[Chorus]
Am             F           C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am   F
Separate my siiii-iiide
  C      G                  Am   F
I don't, don't believe it's baaa-aaad
C                       G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever
 
[Verse 3]
Am                    Em
  Pour my life into a paper cup
Am                           Em
  The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
Am                       Em
  She wants to know am I still a slut
            G              A*
I've got to take it on the otherside
 
[Verse 4]
Am                          Em
  Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
Am                  Em
  A candidate for a soul mate bled
Am                     Em
  Push the trigger and pull the thread
            G              A
I've got to take it on the otherside
G              A
Take it on the otherside
G*
Take it on
A*
Take it on
 
[Chorus]
Am             F           C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am   F
Separate my siiii-iiide
  C      G                  Am   F
I don't, don't believe it's baaa-aaad
C                       G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever
 
[Instrumental]
Em* - C*
Em* - C*
 
[Bridge]
Em*
  Turn me on take me for a hard ride
C*
  Burn me out leave me on the otherside
Em*
  I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
C*
  I tear it down I tear it down, and then it's born again
 
[Guitar Solo]
Am   F   C   G
 
[Chorus]
Am              F           C
  How long, how long will I slide?
G           Am    F
Separate my siiii-iiide
  C      G                  Am   F
I don't, don't believe it's baaa-aaad
C                       G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever
 
Am   F       C      G                  Am    F
Haaa-aaad, I don't, don't believe it's saaa-aaad
C                        G          Am
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever
