OneRepublic - Secrets

Capo on 2nd
 
 
[Intro]
 
C  Em/B  Am  F
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
               C
I need another story 
                  Em/B
Something to get off my chest 
                    Am
My life gets kinda boring 
                       F
Need something that I can confess 
 
             C
Til' all my sleeves are stained red 
              Em/B
From all the truth that I've said 
           Am
Come by it honestly I swear 
                  F
Thought you saw a wink, no 
 F
I've been on the brink, so 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 C
Tell me what you want to hear
                     Em/B
Something that will light those ears 
                Am
Sick of all the insincere 
                  F
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
C                               Em/B
  This time, don't need another perfect lie
                             Am
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
               F
I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C                        Em/B
  My god, amazing how we got this far 
                        Am
It's like we're chasing all those stars 
                    F
Who's driving shiny big black cars 
 
        C
And everyday I see the news 
 
All the problems that we could solve
             Em/B
And when a situation rises 
 
Just write it into an album
          Am
Send it straight to gold
                F
I don't really like my flow, no, so 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 C
Tell me what you want to hear
                     Em/B
Something that will light those ears 
                Am
Sick of all the insincere 
                  F
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
C                               Em/B
  This time, don't need another perfect lie
                             Am
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
               F
I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
C  Em/B  Am  F
 
 
[Bridge]
 
     C                         Em/B
Oooh, got no reason, got not shame 
                    Am
Got no family I can blame 
                       F
Just don't let me disappear 
F
I'mma tell you everything 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 C
Tell me what you want to hear 
                     Em/B
Something that will light those ears
                Am
Sick of all the insincere 
                  F
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
C                               Em/B
  This time, don't need another perfect lie
                             Am
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
               F
I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
F
All my secrets away, All my secrets away.
