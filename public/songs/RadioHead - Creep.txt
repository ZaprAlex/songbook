RadioHead - Creep

                      C
When you were here before,
                          E
couldn't look you in the eye. 
                    F
You're just like an angel,
                     Fm
your skin makes me cry. 
                  C
You float like a feather,
                E
in a beautiful world 
               F
I wish I was special, 
                    Fm
you're so fucking special.

Chorus:
                C           E
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
                              F
    What the hell am I doing here?
                    Fm
    I don't belong here. 

                    C
I don't care if it hurts, 
                    E
I want to have control. 
                  F
I want a perfect body,
                  Fm
I want a perfect soul.
               C
I want you to notice,
               E
when I'm not around. 
                    F
You're so fucking special,
               Fm
I wish I was special.

Chorus:
                C           E
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
                              F
    What the hell am I doing here?
                    Fm
    I don't belong here. 

C                       E
She's running out the door, 
  F
she's running, 
  Fm
she run, run, run, run, run.

                    C
Whatever makes you happy, 
              E
whatever you want. 
                    F
You're so fucking special,
               Fm
I wish I was special,

Chorus:
                C           E
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
                              F
    What the hell am I doing here?
                    Fm
    I don't belong here. 
                   C
    I don't belong here.
