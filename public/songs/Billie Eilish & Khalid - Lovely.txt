Verse 1 
C 
Thought I found a way
Em                        Bm 
Thought I found a way, yeah (found)
     C 
But you never go away (never go away)
     Em                   Bm     
So I guess I gotta stay now

Pre-Chorus 
         C                 Em      Bm 
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
    C                     Em       Bm 
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
         C                  Em        Bm 
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
     C                    Em        Bm 
Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear

Chorus 
C 
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Em                       Bm 
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
C 
Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
Em         Bm            C 
   Hello, welcome home

Verse 2 
C 
Walkin' out of time
Em                            Bm 
Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
C 
Something's on my mind
Em                       Bm 
Always in my headspace

Pre-Chorus 
         C                 Em      Bm 
But I know some day I'll make it out of here
    C                     Em       Bm 
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
         C                  Em        Bm 
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
     C                   Em        Bm 
Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear

Chorus 
C 
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Em                       Bm 
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone

Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
