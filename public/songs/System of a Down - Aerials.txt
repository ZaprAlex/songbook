System of a Down - Aerials


[Verse 1]
Gm
Life is a waterfall,
        Fm                      Abm                    Cm
We're one in the river and one again after the fall.
Gm
Swimming through the void
                       Fm                  Abm         Cm
We hear the word, we lose ourselves, but we find it all!
Gm
Cause we are the ones that want to play,
Fm                          Abm             Cm
Always want to go, but you never want to stay.
Gm
And we are the ones that want to choose,
Fm                           Abm                Cm
Always want to play, but you never want to lose.

Eb5  Fm   Gm  Abm    Gm
When you lose small mind,
Fm  Eb5   Dm   Cm
You free your life.
