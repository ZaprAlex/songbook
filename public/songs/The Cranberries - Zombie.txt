Вступление: Em | Cmaj7 | G6 | Em11/F# x4

Куплет 1:
Em       Cmaj7
Another head hangs lowly
  G6               Em11/F#
Child is slowly taken
Em                Cmaj7
And the violence caused such silence
  G6             Em11/F#
Who are we mistaken?

Предприпев:
         Em                         Cmaj7
But you see, it’s not me, it’s not my family
         G6                               Em11/F#
In your head, in your head, they are fightin’
            Em                              Cmaj7
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
         G6                            Em11/F#
In your head, in your head, they are cryin’

Припев:
             Em            Cmaj7
    In your head, in your head
        G6              Em11/F#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
                    Em            Cmaj7
    What’s in your head, in your head?
        G6              Em11/F#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Постприпев:
Em
Du, du, du, du

Du, du, du, du

Куплет 2:
Em       Cmaj7
Another mother’s breakin’
 G6               Em11/F#
Heart is takin’ over
  Em               Cmaj7
When the violence causes silence
G6 Em11/F#
We must be mistaken

Предприпев:
          Em                                Cmaj7
It’s the same old theme, since nineteen sixteen
         G6                                    Em11/F#
In your head, in your head, they’re still fightin’
            Em                              Cmaj7
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
         G6                           Em11/F#
In your head, in your head, they are dyin’

Припев:
             Em            Cmaj7
    In your head, in your head
        G6              Em11/F#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
                    Em            Cmaj7
    What’s in your head, in your head?
        G6              Em11/F#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie
