The Cranberries - Zombie

[Intro]
Em C G D/F#  x4
 
[Verse 1]
Em       C                G                D/F#
Another head hangs lowly, child is slowly taken
Em               C                    G               D/F#
And the violence caused such silence, who are we mistaken 
        Em                        C
But you see it's not me, it's not my family
        G                               D/F#
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
           Em                              C
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns 
         G                             D/F#
in your head, in your head, they are crying
 
[Chorus 1]
        Em            C            G             D/F#
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Em            C            G             D/F#
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
 
[Instrumental]
Em C G D/F# x2
 
[Verse 2]
Em        C                  G              D/F#
Another mother's breaking heart is taking over
Em                C               G            D/F#
When the violence causes silence, we must be mistaken
         Em                   C
It's the same old theme since 1916
        G                                  D/F#
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
           Em                              C
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
        G                            D/F#
In your head, in your head, they're dying
 
[Chorus 2]
        Em            C            G             D/F#
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Em            C            G             D/F#
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie
