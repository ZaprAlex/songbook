James Arthur - Lasting Lover

[Intro]
C
 
[Verse 1]
C
I don't know why I can't quite get you out my sight
       F
You're always just behind, thought across my mind
C
Keep crawling back to where we last left our love on hold
     F
I'm always up for more so what you waiting for?
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                Am      G      F
Wait, before you burn me to the ground
       G              Am         G          F
Please stay until the beat of my heart runs out
 
[Chorus]
             C
I don't wanna let go, let go
                       G
'Cause I've been tryna' hold on for too long
                 Am
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
 
Take my heart and run away
         F                                      C
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover to save me, save me
                 G
From every single heartache, heartache"
                 Am
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
 
Take my heart and run away
         F                                       C
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

[Verse 2]
C
One by one now and two by twice
                                F
I've watched all my loves move on to something more
 
Up and out the door
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                Am      G      F
Caught in between every passing hour
        G              Am            G           F
Oh please stay till the taste in your mouth turns sour
 
[Chorus]
             C
I don't wanna let go, let go
                       G
'Cause I've been tryna' hold on for too long
                 Am
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
 
Take my heart and run away
         F                                      C
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover to save me, save me
                 G
From every single heartache, heartache"
                 Am
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
                                    F
Take my heart and run away,
 
I’ve been looking for a lover
 
[Bridge]
        G           Am         G          F
So let me know, did we ever mean anything at all?
           G            Am        G           F
So, let me know, did we ever mean anything at all?
                 G
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
        Am             G         F
Take my heart and run away, she said
                 G
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
         Am            G        F
Take my heart and run away, she said, “I’ve been looking for a lasting lover”
