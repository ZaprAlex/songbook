Lifehouse - Storm

Em              C2
  how long have I
             G
been in this storm
Em        D                               G
  so overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Em                C2        G
  water's getting harder to tread
Em           D                      G
  with these waves crashing over my head
 
 
                    Em
if I could just see you
C2                   G
  everything will be alright
         Em
if I see you
    D                     G
the darkness will turn to light
 
 
Em    C              G
  and I will walk on water
Em             D             G
  and you will catch me if I fall
Em    C2         G    D/F#      Em
  and I will get lost into your eyes
C2            D               G     D/F#
  I know everything will be alright
Em          D/F#         Em
  I know everything is alright
 
 
Em
I know you didn't
C2                   G
bring me out here to drown
   Em                D                G
so why am I ten feet under and upside down
Em          C2                 G
barely surviving has become my purpose
      Em             D                      G
cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
 
 
                    Em
if I could just see you
C2                   G
  everything will be alright
         Em
if I see you
    D                     G
the darkness will turn to light
 
 
Em    C              G
  and I will walk on water
Em             D             G
  and you will catch me if I fall
Em    C2         G    D/F#      Em
  and I will get lost into your eyes
C2            D               G
  I know everything will be alright
Em    C              G
  and I will walk on water
Em             D             G
  and you will catch me if I fall
Em    C2         G    D/F#      Em
  and I will get lost into your eyes
C2            D               G     D/F#
  I know everything will be alright
Em          D/F#         Em
  I know everything is alright
