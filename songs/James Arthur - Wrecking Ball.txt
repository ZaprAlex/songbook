James Arthur - Wrecking Ball

(Capo on 3)
 
[Verse 1]
Em                      G
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
     D                  C
We jumped never asking why
    Em              G
We kissed, I fell under your spell
   D                  C
A love no one could deny
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  Em
Don't you ever say I just walked away
G                  C
I will always want you
C                   Em
I can't live a lie, running for my life
G                  C
I will always want you
 
[Chorus 1]
                 G           D
I came in like a wrecking ball
               Em         C
I never hit so hard in love
                    G             D
All I wanted was to break your walls
                     Em    C
All you ever did was wreck me
               Em    C
Yeah, you, you wreck me
 
[Verse 2]
  Em                      G
I put you high up in the sky
    D                      C
And now, you're not coming down
   Em                        G
It slowly turned, you let me burn
    D                       C
And now, we're ashes on the ground
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  Em
Don't you ever say I just walked away
G                  C
I will always want you
C                   Em
I can't live a lie, running for my life
G                  C
I will always want you
 
[Chorus 1]
                 G           D
I came in like a wrecking ball
               Em         C
I never hit so hard in love
                    G              D
All I wanted was to break your walls
                     Em     C
All you ever did was wreck me
 
[Chorus 2]
                 G           D
I came in like a wrecking ball
               Em         C
I never hit so hard in love
                    G             D
All I wanted was to break your walls
                     Em    C
All you ever did was wreck me
               Em    C
Yeah, you, you wreck me
 
[Bridge]
C                        Em
I never meant to start a war
                            G
I just wanted you to let me in
                     D
And instead of using force
                            C
I guess I should've let you win
                         Em
I never meant to start a war
                            G
I just wanted you to let me in
                            D7
I guess I should've let you win
 
[Interlude]
C                  Em
Don't you ever say I just walked away
G                  C
I will always want you
 
[Chorus 1]
                G           D
I came in like a wrecking ball
               Em         C
I never hit so hard in love
                    G              D
All I wanted was to break your walls
                     Em     C
All you ever did was wreck me
 
[Chorus 2]
                 G           D
I came in like a wrecking ball
               Em         C
I never hit so hard in love
                    G             D
All I wanted was to break your walls
                     Em    C
All you ever did was wreck me
               Em    C
Yeah, you, you wreck me
