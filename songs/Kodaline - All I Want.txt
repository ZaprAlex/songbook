Kodaline - All I Want

[Verse 1]
 
C             F       C
All I want is nothing more
   C                 G/B    Am
To hear you knocking at my door
          F                          C
Cause' if I could see your face once more
        F                   C
I could die a happy man I'm sure
 
C                  F        C
When you said your last goodbye
  C             G/B   Am
I died a little bit inside
  F                       C
I lay in tears in bed all night
 F                      C    G/B
Alone without you by my side
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Am
But if you loved me
          F
Why'd' ya leave me
        C
Take my body
        G
Take my body
 
      Am
All I want is
          F
And all I need is
            C
To find somebody
              G
I'll find somebody
 
 
[Interlude]
 
     C      F      C
Like youuu, ohhhh, oh

[Verse 2]
 
   C                   F       C
So you brought out the best of me,
  C               G/B    Am
A part of me I've never seen.
    F                         C
You took my soul and wiped it clean.
     F                      C       G/B
Our love was made for movie screens.
 
 
[Chorus]

But if you loved me

Why'd' ya leave me
        C
Take my body

Take my body
 
      Am
All I want is
          F
And all I need is
            C
To find somebody
              G
I'll find somebody
