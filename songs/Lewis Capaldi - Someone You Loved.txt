[Intro]
C   G   Am  F
 
 
[Verse 1]
C                          G                              Am     F
  I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
C                            G                        Am     F
  This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
                     C                 G 
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know,
             Am                F
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
              C                      G
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Am                                F
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
 
 
[Chorus]
                C             G
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Am                         F
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                            G                               Am     F
   I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
C                            G                           Am     F
  This all or nothing way of lovin' got me sleepin' without you
                         C                 G   
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal,
             Am                         F
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
              C                      G
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Am                             F
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
 
 
[Chorus]
               C                G
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Am                        F
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Bridge]
    Dm           Am                  G
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
                 Dm7
I fall into your arms
         Am7                         G
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.                 C                G
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Am                        F
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
                    C                G
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Am                        F
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Outro]
                  C                            G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F     C
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
