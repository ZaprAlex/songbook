[Verse I]
Am7         F                   C
 Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
                     C/B            Am7
 You don't know how lovely you are
            F                   C
 I had to find you, tell you I need you
            C/B            Am7
 Tell you I set you apart
              F                        C
 Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
            C/B                 Am7
 Oh let's go back to the start
            F                   C
 Running in circles, coming up tails
            C/B
 Heads on a science apart
 
[Chorus]
F                         C
 Nobody said it was easy
             C/B
 It's such a shame for us to part
F                         C
 Nobody said it was easy
             C/B                              G
 No one ever said that it would be this hard
Dm7                       C
 Oh take me back to the start

[Verse II]
Am7         F                       C
 I was just guessing at numbers and figures
             C              Am7
 Pulling the puzzles apart
              F                    C
 Questions of science, science and progress
                 C                 Am7
 Do not speak as loud as my heart
             F                      C
 Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
          C           C/B    Am7
 Oh and I rush to the start
            F                    C
 Running in circles, chasing our tails
        C          C/B
 Coming back as we are
 
[Chorus]
F                         C
 Nobody said it was easy
             C/B
 It's such a shame for us to part
F                         C
 Nobody said it was easy
             C/B                        G
 No one ever said it would be so hard
Dm7                      C
 I'm going back to the start
