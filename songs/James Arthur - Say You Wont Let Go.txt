James Arthur - Say You Wont Let Go

[Intro]
G D Em C
 
[Verse 1]
G
  I met you in the dark
D
  You lit me up
Em
  You made me feel as though
C
  I was enough
 
G
  We danced the night away
D
  We drank too much
Em
  I held your hair back when
C
  You were throwing up
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G
  Then you smiled over your shoulder
D
  For a minute, I was stone cold sober
Em                         C
  I pulled you closer to my chest
 
G
  And you asked me to stay over
D
  I said, I already told ya
Em                                C
  I think that you should get some rest
 
[Chorus]
G
  I knew I loved you then
D
  But you'd never know
Em
  Cause I played it cool when I was 
C
Scared of letting go
 
G
  I know I needed you
D
  But I never showed
Em
  But I wanna stay with you
  C
Until we're grey and old
 
     G                   D
Just say you won't let go
     Em                  C
Just say you won't let go
 
[Verse 2]
G
  I wake you up with some
D
  Breakfast in bed
Em
  I'll bring you coffee with 
C
  a kiss on your head
 
G
  And I'll take the kids to school
D
  Wave them goodbye
Em
  And I'll thank my lucky stars 
C
  for that night
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G
  When you looked over your shoulder
D
  For a minute, I forget that I'm older
Em                            C
  I wanna dance with you right now, oh
 
G
And you look as beautiful as ever
D
  And I swear that everyday you'll get better
Em                          C
  You make me feel this way somehow
 
[Chorus]
G
  I'm so in love with you
D
  And I hope you know
Em
  Darling your love is more than
C
  Worth its weight in gold
 
G
  We've come so far my dear
D
  Look how we've grown
Em
  And I wanna stay with you
  C
Until we're grey and old
 
     G                   D
Just say you won't let go
     Em                  C
Just say you won't let go
 
[Verse 3]
G
  I wanna live with you
D
  Even when we're ghosts
Em
  Cause you were always there for me
     C
When I needed you most
 
[Chorus]
G
  I'm gonna love you till
D
  My lungs give out
Em
  I promise till death we part
C
Like in our vows
 
G
  So I wrote this song for you
D
  Now everybody knows
Em
  That it's just you and me
  C
Until we're grey and old
 
[Outro]
     G                   D
Just say you won't let go
     Em                  C
Just say you won't let go
 
     G                   D
Just say you won't let go
         Em                  C
Oh, just say you won't let go
 
G
(end on single strum)
