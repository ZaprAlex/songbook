Intro: D

D            
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
A
I was in your sights, you got me alone
Bm                    G
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e

D
I guess you didn't care, and I guess liked that
   A
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
   Bm               G       D
Without me, without me, without meeeee

         A                Bm
And he's long gone, when he's next to me and I 
     G             
Realize the blame is on me

(one strum)
     Bm         G                A
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
     D     A   Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow
       G            A
Flew me to places I'd never been 
       D   A
'Till you put me down, oh
Bm         G                 A

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
  A
Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why
     Bm                      G 
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing

    D
Now I heard you moved on, the whispers on the street
 A
–ê new notch in your belt, it's all I'll ever be
   Bm              G           D
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e

        A           Bm
