↡↑↓↑↓↑↓↑

Verse 1:
Dm
Counting days, counting days
                         Bb      F
Since my love up and got lost on me
Dm
And every breath that I've been taking
           C                Bb       F
Since you left feels like a waste on me
Dm
I've been holding on to hope
                 Am                Bb         F
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
Dm
Cause every word that I've heard spoken
           C                 Bb       F
Since you left feels like a hollow street

Pre-Chorus:
Bb                                                    Dm
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
                              C                          Bb
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
                                         Dm   Am
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Chorus:
                               Bb Dm
There must be something in the water
                             Am Bb
Cause every day it's getting colder
                     C   Dm
And if only I could hold you
                              Am Bb
You'd keep my head from going under

Verse 2:
Dm                             C
Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
        Bb       F
By the brighter side
Dm
Of what we had because it's over
             C                Bb      F
Well, there must be something in the tide

Pre-Chorus:
Bb                                                    Dm
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
                              C                          Bb
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
                                         Dm   Am
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Chorus:
                               Bb Dm
There must be something in the water
                              Am Bb
Cause every day it's getting colder
                     C   Dm
And if only I could hold you
                              Am Bb
You'd keep my head from going under

Bridge:
            Bb  Dm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Am  Bb
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            C   Dm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Am  Bb
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Gm
It's your love I'm lost in
F
Your love I'm lost in
Dm
Your love I'm lost in
C
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Gm
Your love I'm lost in
F
Your love I'm lost in
Dm
Your love I'm lost in
C                              Bb  Dm
Even though I'm nothing to you now
                               Am  Bb
Even though I'm nothing to you now

Chorus:
                               Bb Dm
There must be something in the water
                              Am Bb
Cause every day it's getting colder
                     C   Dm
And if only I could hold you
                              Am Bb
You'd keep my head from going under
                               Bb Dm
There must be something in the water
                              Am Bb
Cause every day it's getting colder
                     C   Dm
And if only I could hold you
                              Am Bb
You'd keep my head from going under
