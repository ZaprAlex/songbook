Ed Sheeran - The A Team Chords

[Intro]
 
G     G   D/F# Em   C G
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G
White lips, pale face
               D/F# Em
Breathing in snowflakes
              C    G
Burnt lungs, sour taste
G
Light's gone, day's end
              D/F# Em
Struggling to pay rent
                C    G
Long nights, strange men
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      Am
And they say
                   C
She's in the Class A Team
               G
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#
Been this way since 18
                Am
But lately her face seems
                 C
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F#
The worst things in life come free to us
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Em            C
Cos we're just under the upperhand
G
And go mad for a couple grams
Em                    C      G
And she don't want to go outside tonight
          Em                    C
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
G
Or sells love to another man
Em        C       G
It's too cold outside
              Em  C  G
For angels to fly
           Em  C  G
Angels to fly
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
Ripped gloves, raincoat
                    D/F#  Em
Tried to swim and stay afloat
            C   G
Dry house, wet clothes
G
Loose change, bank notes
             D/F# Em
Weary-eyed, dry throat
           C    G
Call girl, no phone
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      Am
And they say
                   C
She's in the Class A Team
              G
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#
Been this way since 18
               Am
But lately her face seems
                 C
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F#
The worst things in life come free to us
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em                  C
Cos we're just under the upperhand
G
And go mad for a couple grams
Em                    C      G
And she don't want to go outside tonight
         Em                     C
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
G
Or sells love to another man
Em        C       G
It's too cold outside
              Am
For angels to fly
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am             C
An angel will die
             Em
Covered in white
 
Closed eye
         G
And hoping for a better life
Am                         C
This time, we'll fade out tonight
                  Em C G
Straight down the line
 
Em C G
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      Am
And they say
                   C
She's in the Class A Team
              G
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#
Been this way since 18
               Am
But lately her face seems
                 C
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F#
The worst things in life come free to us
 
 
[Chorus/Outro]
 
          Em             C
Cos we're all under the upperhand
G
And go mad for a couple grams
Em                   C     G
And we don't want to go outside tonight
          Em                 C
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
G
Or sell love to another man
Em        C       G
It's too cold outside
               Em C G
For angels to fly
            Em C G
Angels to fly
   Em C  G
To fly, fly
           Em      C       G
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
   D/F#    G
Angels to die
